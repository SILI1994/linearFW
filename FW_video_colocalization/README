There are already pre-compiled versions of the mex files in the solvers
directory for Linux, Mac and Windows 64 bits, so the code might run
fine as is in Matlab. Otherwise, you need first to compile the mex files:
1) Go to the solvers directory, run "mex solver_video_mex.cpp"

Then to launch the script, go back to this folder and:
2) run "run_FW.m"

The AFW.m function was based on their code, but then modified using a hashing
function for the active set to be more efficient.

The FW, PFW and AFW code were modified by:
